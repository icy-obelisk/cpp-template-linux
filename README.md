# How to use

## Software preparation

install`gcc`/`clang`, `make`/`ninja`, `clangd`, `clang-format` and `cmake`.

Optionally, you may want to use `gdb` or `lldb` to debug your program.

## Setup environment

```bash
source env.sh
```

This will append environment variable `PATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to run the program directly from the terminal.

## Compile the project

```bash
sh compile.sh
```

This will generate a file named `compile_commands.json` to help clangd to find local header files.

If you intended to use `clang` and `ninja` to build, add `-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -G "Ninja"` at the end of `cmake` command in `compile.sh`.

Optionally, you may want to debug the program later. To enable debug symbol, add `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` at the end of `cmake` command in `compile.sh`.

## Run the project

```bash
cpp-sample
```

Optionally, debug the program using `gdb` or `lldb`.

```bash
gdb cpp-sample
```

```bash
lldb cpp-sample
```

## (Optional) Clean the build files

```bash
sh clean.sh
```

This will remove build files generated by `cmake`.

# Recommended IDE

I personally use `vscodium` with the following extensions:

```plain text
clangd - made by llvm
    Autocomplete/Format C++ code

CMake - made by twxs
    Autocomplete CMake code
```
